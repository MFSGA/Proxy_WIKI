# Introduction

This documentation set introduces the proxy ecosystem maintained in this repository, focusing on three core projects: `Chimera_Client`, `Chimera`, and `Chimera_Server`. Each module targets a different layer of the overall stack—client core, client GUI, and server core—but they share a common goal: delivering reliable, high-performance connectivity under diverse network conditions. The following chapters explain how these applications work together, what problems each component solves, and how teams can deploy and extend them.

In addition, the documentation for each project is generally divided into two major parts: one is a configuration guide for general users, intended for quick onboarding and day-to-day usage; the other is an advanced reference for developers, intended to help them understand implementation details, extension capabilities, and support further development.
