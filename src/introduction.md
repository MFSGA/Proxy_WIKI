# Introduction

This documentation set explains the proxy ecosystem maintained in this repository, focusing on three primary projects: `chimera_client`, `Chimera`, and `chimera_server`. Each module targets a different layer of the overall stack—client experience, server-side ingress, and reusable protocol logic—yet they share a common goal: delivering reliable, high-performance connectivity under diverse network conditions. The following chapters describe how the pieces fit together, what problems each component solves, and how teams can deploy and extend them.
