# Preface

The landscape of proxy applications has become crowded and fragmented, so—out of personal interest—I decided to consolidate the ones I use into a single stack.
- `Chimera_Client` takes inspiration from the open-source [clash-rs] project, with the long-term goal of matching [Mihomo]'s feature set. 
- `Chimera` follows the [clash-nyanpasu] project, but the key difference is that my top priority is first-class support for the `chimera_client` engine itself, which can largely be considered the `clash-rs` core.
- `Chimera_Server` project can be viewed as a Rust implementation of [xray-core], with compatibility with the original `xray-core` remaining the end goal.Additionally, its implementation is based on the open-source project [shoes].
